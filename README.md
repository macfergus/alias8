# alias8

This is an Ableton Live 9 remote script for Livid Alias 8 control surface. If you have an Alias 8, and you use Live, and you want to use your Alias 8 for basic mixing type controls, this is for you.

If you use Live, but you don't have an Alias 8, you might find this useful as an example for creating your own remote scripts.

## How to install

If you have a Mac, you may be able to install by typing `make install` in the shell. It will attempt to guess the location of your remote scripts, but I suppose it could easily guess wrong. In that case copy the files by hand.

To use the encoder for scrolling through tracks, you'll need to configure the encoder knob to "relative" mode (out of the box, it's set to "absolute" mode). Use the editor supplied by Livid to do this.
